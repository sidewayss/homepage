<div style="flex:1 1 auto; margin:8px 0 8px 0; overflow-y:auto;">
    <p>The late, great Rodney Dangerfield, quoting the later, greater William
       Shakespeare, said:</p>
    <p>&ensp;<i>"Even William Shakespeare said 'What's in a name?'"</i></p>
    <p style="margin-top:8px;">
       Sideways's parents met in the Catskills shortly after The Woodstock Music
       &amp; Art Fair. His father, Robert, fancied himself a playwrite. He had
       recently changed his last name to Skullfucker for reasons he often
       explained, but no one ever understood. He was hanging around Hunter
       Mountain, chilling out after some heavy tripping during the festival.
       Sideways's mother, Mary, was studying to be a teacher. She was visiting
       her parents at their country home in the Catskills. Their versions differ
       as to how the romance began, but everyone agrees that they were married
       on May 23rd, 1970, less than a year later.</p>
    <p>That winter Sideways was conceived. Born on November 15th 1971, Sideways
       Martha Franklin Skullfucker weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. He was in a
       so-called "transverse" or sideways position in the womb when Mary went
       into labor, making it extremely difficult for her. Fortunately the
       midwife was able to rotate the fetus into a normal position, and avoid a
       trip to the hospital for a C-section.</p>
    <p>Though they had already decided on the middle names, Robert and Mary
       believed it was important to give the child a spontaneous first name at
       the time of its birth, and this transverse position of the fetus gave
       them the idea to name the boy Sideways.</p>
    <p>The bicentennial of The Declaration of Independence was on the horizon
       and both Robert and Mary were big fans of the American Revolution. Martha
       Washington was Mary's hero, and Benjamin Franklin was Robert's. The
       double middle name allowed them to decide on the middle name prior to the
       birth without knowing the gender of the child.</p>
    <p>Robert and Mary were living in a commune in Northern Vermont at the time
       of Sideways's birth, and were paranoid about government intrusion into
       their lives, so there is not much documentation regarding the first year
       of Sideways's life. Robert didn't handle fatherhood well. He left the
       commune, and his wife and child, 5 months after Sideways was born. In the
       fall of 1972 Mary Skullfucker moved out of the commune and back to New
       York City with her parents.</p>
    <p>On July 5th, 1976, Robert Skullfucker was involuntarily placed in a state
       psychiatric hospital. He spent the rest of his life in and out of
       hospitals and half-way houses until his death in 2005. Sideways did not
       see much of his father growing up, and saw even less of him as an adult.</p>
    <p>Sideways's maternal grandparents and their maid, Beryl, played a pivotal
       role in raising him. Sideways was an excellent student. He attended a
       top-tier New England prep school, and graduated Cum Laude from an Ivy
       League university, where he majored in music.</p>
    <p>After university, Sideways drifted between various temp jobs, eventually
       acquiring computer programming skills which allowed him to get better
       jobs. He continued working as a temp of sorts - they called it
       "contracting". It started paying well and he made a career out of it,
       until it ended.</p>
   <p>Eventually he ran out of other things to do, and he created this music and
      this website.</p>
